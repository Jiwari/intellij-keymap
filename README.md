# intellij-keymap
My IntelliJ keymap for development.

Most of the keymap is the default, and only the following have been changed:

 - Select in Project View - Not set by default, added `Alt+W` mapping
 - Duplicate Line or Selecion - Removed `Ctrl+D` mapping
 - Duplicate Entire Lines - Not set by default, added `Ctrl+D` mapping
 - Move Caret to Next Word - Removed `Ctrl+Right` mapping
 - Move Caret to Next Word in Different "CammelHumps" Mode - Not set by default, added `Ctrl+Right` mapping. Same behavior that is on Eclipse for `Ctrl+Right`
 - Move Caret to Previous Word - Removed `Ctrl+Left` mapping
 - Move Caret to Previous Word in Different "CammelHumps" Mode - Not set by default, added `Ctrl+Left` mapping. Same behavior that is on Eclipse for `Ctrl+Left`
